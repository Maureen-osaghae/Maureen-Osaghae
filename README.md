# 👋 Hi, I’m Maureen Osaghae  
### ☁️ Cloud Engineer | AWS Solutions Architect | Cloud Security Enthusiast  

I’m a **results-driven Cloud Engineer** with hands-on experience designing, deploying, and securing **scalable AWS infrastructures**. My work bridges the gap between business strategy and technical implementation — helping organizations modernize, automate, and secure their systems in the cloud.  

I’m passionate about **automation, observability, and AI-powered solutions** that improve performance, security, and cost efficiency.

## 💡 What I Do  
- 🧱 **Design & Deploy Secure AWS Architectures** – VPCs, subnets, NAT Gateways, and IAM policies using **Terraform** and **CloudFormation**.  
- 🔐 **Cloud Security & Compliance** – Implementing AWS **Config**, **GuardDuty**, **WAF**, and encryption best practices.  
- 🔁 **Automation & DevOps** – Building CI/CD pipelines with **CodePipeline, CodeCommit**, and **GitHub Actions**.  
- ☁️ **Serverless & Event-Driven Systems** – Architecting scalable applications with **Lambda, SNS, SQS, and DynamoDB**.  
- 🤖 **Generative AI & Machine Learning** – Leveraging AI to analyze campaign data and predict customer behavior.  

---

## 🚀 Featured Projects  
- **AWS Infrastructure Automation** — Designed secure, reusable AWS environments using Terraform, automating deployments and eliminating manual setup.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline Build** — Implemented automated deployments and versioning with CodePipeline + CodeCommit.  
- **Event-Driven Architecture** — Built Lambda-based automation triggered by S3 and DynamoDB for cost-optimized scaling.  
- **Security Observability Dashboard** — Created CloudWatch dashboards integrated with CloudTrail logs to detect IAM policy anomalies in real time.  
- **Automated Compliance Monitoring** — Deployed AWS Config + Lambda to auto-remediate S3 bucket misconfigurations.
- **Designed and Deployed Secure AWS Infrastructure** — Built multi-tier architecture with VPC, public/private subnets, NAT Gateway, and SSM-based access. Eliminated the need for public IPs or SSH keys, strengthening security compliance.
