Designing a 3-Tier Architecture on AWS 
- Built a scalable, fault-tolerant 3-tier architecture using EC2 (web/app tier), RDS (database), and S3 (static content) 
- Configured VPC, public/private subnets, NAT gateways, and security groups 
- Automated deployment with CloudFormation and Terraform 
Implementing a Serverless Architecture 
- Replaced traditional backend with Lambda + API Gateway for event-driven compute 
- Used DynamoDB as a fast, highly available database backend 
Automating Code Deployments with AWS CodeDeploy
- Set up CodeDeploy and GitHub Actions for automated rollout of application code to EC2 instances 
- Integrated pre-deployment validation and post-deployment health checks 
- Used S3 as an artifact store and CloudWatch for deployment metrics 

Migrating a Web App to Docker Containers 
- Containerized a Node.js web application for local and AWS deployment 
- Built and pushed images to ECR, deployed on ECS using Fargate 
- Applied container security best practices and resource limits 
Containerization with Docker 
 - Migrated monolithic Node.js app to Docker containers, built custom Dockerfiles, and deployed to AWS  ECS using Fargate. 
Break a Monolithic Node.js App into Microservices 
- Split services into smaller Lambda-based functions behind API Gateway 
- Improved scalability, fault isolation, and deployment flexibility 
- Managed inter-service communication via REST APIs and environment variables
Monitoring Logging &  Security Hardening 
 -  Configured CloudWatch dashboards and alerts for infrastructure and application-level metrics. 
 - Applied IAM policies, encryption, and VPC security groups to ensure environment compliance and  isolation.
